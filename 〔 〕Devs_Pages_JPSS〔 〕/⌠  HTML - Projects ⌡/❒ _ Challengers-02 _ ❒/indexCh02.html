                The wall on which the prophets wrote<br>
                Is cracking at the seams<br>
                Upon the instruments of death<br>
                The sunlight brightly gleams</p>

                When every man is torn apart<br>
                With nightmares and with dreams<br>
                Will no one lay the laurel wreath<br>
                When silence drowns the screams</p>

                Confusion will be my epitaph<br>
                As I crawl a cracked and broken path<br>
                If we make it we can all sit back and laugh<br>
                But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying<br>
                Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying<br>
                Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying</p>

                Between the iron gates of fate<br>
                The seeds of time were sown<br>
                And watered by the deeds of those<br>
                Who know and who are known</p>

                Knowledge is a deadly friend<br>
                If no one sets the rules<br>
                The fate of all mankind I see<br>
                Is in the hands of fools</p>
