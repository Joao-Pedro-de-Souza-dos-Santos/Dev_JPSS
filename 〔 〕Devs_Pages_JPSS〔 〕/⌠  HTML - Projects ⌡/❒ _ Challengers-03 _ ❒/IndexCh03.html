                <p>
                    Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
                </p>

                <p>
                    The ruins of the day painted with a scar<br>
                    And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh-oh, forgiving who you are, for what you stand to gain<br>
                    Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away<br>
                    When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded<br>
                    Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age
                </p>
                <p>
                    Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
                </p>
                <p>
                    The carvings on the face say they find it hard
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
                </p>
                <p>
                    The humor's not the same, coming from denial
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh-oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange<br>
                    I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away<br>
                    If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone<br>
                    Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange<br>
                    You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away<br>
                    If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone<br>
                    Horrified on the stage, my little dark age<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
                </p>
                <p>
                    The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind
                </p>
                <p>
                    Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns<br>
                    I know my friends and I would probably turn and run<br>
                    If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge<br>
                    Bring a stone, all the rage, my little dark age<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange<br>
                    I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away<br>
                    If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone<br>
                    Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All alone, open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
                </p>
